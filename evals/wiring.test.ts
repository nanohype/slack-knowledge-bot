/**
 * The offline tier's wiring assertions.
 *
 * `harness.test.ts` asks whether the golden set and the graders are sound.
 * This asks whether the tier can start at all — a different question, and the
 * one that was quietly answered "no".
 *
 * `evals.yml` set `EVAL_LLM: bedrock`, the direct-to-Bedrock backend from
 * before this app moved onto the ModelGateway. the eval accepts only
 * `gateway` and throws on anything else, so a dispatched run failed before
 * reaching a model. Nothing reported it: the workflow is manual-dispatch-only
 * with no schedule, and a tier nobody runs looks exactly like one that works.
 *
 * These read the workflow off disk rather than taking values as parameters.
 * A check handed the value by the thing it is checking agrees with itself.
